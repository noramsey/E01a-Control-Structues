I replied to each of the prompts unders questions .txt and edited the Liscence to reflect my work. I also completed the extra credit , but I'm still not sure entirely about the vocabulary needed to reply to these questions correctly. So far I think I've learned the following: 
    1. Print = display text. 
    2. If = Condition is met. 
    3. Else = Condition is not met. 
    4. Elif = Whether or not the condition is met. 
    5. While = Constantly checked condition. 
    6. Input = Whatever is texted into the dialog box by the user. 
    7. Output (By osmosis) = Whatever is regurgitated by the machine. 
    8.  Indent = happens AFTER non-indented line of code. 
    9. ' ' = PLAIN TEXT
    10. () = converts multiple words into one. So if z = (X, Y) then X and Y will always mean z. 
    11. , = distincts seperate keywords in a ()
And I think that's everything.
